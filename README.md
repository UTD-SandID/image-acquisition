# image-acquisition
React app

This React Native app captures images to expand the dataset for the Sand ID machine learning algorithm. To ensure accurate scaling, a coin must be included in the picture. Users can upload images to a server for processing but need login credentials to do so. If uploading an image immediately after capture, the app sends the current location. Otherwise, the user must manually enter coordinates for previously captured images.
